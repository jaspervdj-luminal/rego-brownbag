# Introduction

## About this talk

 -  Let's learn Rego
     *  We'll compare Rego to a few other languages, including ones which you
        may be familiar with including JavaScript and SQL.
     *  Gradually we'll focus deeper and deeper on what sets Rego apart.
     *  Packages, input, rules

 -  Fugue rules
     *  Simple rules
     *  Advanced rules
     *  Custom error messages

 -  Interactive part

## Tools

We're using fregot:

# What is Rego?

## Rego is like JavaScript

Scalars: Numbers, strings, booleans, `null`

```rego
1 + 2
"Hello world"
false
null
```

## Rego is like JavaScript

Compound objects: Arrays

```rego
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
count(arr)  # ?
array.slice(arr, 0, 2)  # ?
arr[0]  # ?
sum(arr)  # ?
```

## Rego is like JavaScript

Compound objects: Objects

```rego
tags = {"owner": "Finance"}
tags.owner  # ?
```

## Rego is like JavaScript

Compound objects: Sets

```rego
allowed_ports = {80, 443, 8080}
count(allowed_ports)  # ?
allowed_ports[80]  # ?
intersection({allowed_ports, {8080}})  # ?
```

## Rego is like JavaScript

Built-in functions

```rego
re_match("^::", "::/0")  # ?
time.now_ns()  # ?
base64.encode("Hello world")  # ?
```

## Rego is like JavaScript

Find natural numbers that add up to 5:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var pairs = [];
for (const x of numbers)
  for (const y of numbers)
    if (x < y && x + y == 5)
      pairs.push([x, y]);

console.log(pairs);  // ?
```

## Rego is like JavaScript

Ok so Rego is actually not like JavaScript:

 -  Immutable (cannot modify `pairs` after assignment)
     *  Obviously has an effect on built-ins
     *  Functional Programming
 -  Not Turing Complete
     *  Guaranteed to terminate
     *  But not that hard to write a query that would take longer than the
        age of the universe to compute
 -  Declarative
     *  Order isn't that important
     *  Non Turing-Completeness allows for tricksâ„¢

## Rego is not like JavaScript

```rego
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
pairs[[x, y]] {
  x + y = 5
  x = numbers[i]
  y = numbers[j]
  i < j
}

pairs[_]  # ?
```

## Rego is like SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE numbers (value INT);
INSERT INTO numbers (value) VALUES (1),(2),(3),(4),(5);

SELECT n1.value, n2.value
FROM numbers AS n1 JOIN numbers AS n2
WHERE n1.value < n2.value AND n1.value + n2.value = 5;
```

...but with first-class JSON support and friendlier syntax

## Rego is like jq

```bash
jq_script='
    .[] as $x | .[] as $y |
    select($x<$y) | select($x+$y==5) |
    [$x, $y]'
echo '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]' | jq -c "$jq_script"
```

...but sometimes you can actually read the code

## Conclusion

 -  Operates on JavaScript values (with the addition of sets)
 -  Syntax looks like JavaScript
 -  But it's not an imperative language
 -  Closer to datalog, SQL, jq, prolog

# Modules, rules and queries

## The Rego tree

In Rego, everything is immutable, which means that almost* everything is data:

    data
    |-package a
    | |-package a.x
    |   |-rule a.x.foo
    |-package b
      |-rule b.bar

## The Rego tree

In `fregot repl`, you're always in the "open" package:

```rego
:open a.x
foo = 1
data  # ?
data.a.x.foo  # ?
```

## The Rego tree

```eval
cat rules/rule0.rego
```

```bash
fregot eval 'data' rules/rule0.rego | jq '.'
```

All your rules are just data!

## The Rego tree

Working with the Rego tree:

    import data.rules.aws.ports_by_account
    foo = ports_by_account.allowed_ports

. . .

    import data.rules.aws
    foo = aws.ports_by_account.allowed_ports

. . .

    import data.rules as top
    foo = top.aws.ports_by_account.allowed_ports

. . .

    foo = data.rules.aws.ports_by_account.allowed_ports

## The Rego tree

Aside from `data.`, there's `input.` which holds the _input document_.

You can set this by using `--input foo.json` on the command line or by using
`:input` in `fregot repl`:

```rego
:input inputs/resource1.json
input.id
```

## The Rego tree: conclusion

Two JSON trees:

 -  `input` is the static input JSON document.  In the case of Fugue Rules, this
    is either a single resource or a collection of resources.

 -  `data` is derived _from input_ through the rules you load, but it is also
    just a static document.

## What is inside the Rego tree?

Rules and functions.

    package rules.aws.ports_by_account

    resource_type = "aws_security_group"

## What is inside the Rego tree?

Rules can have _bodies_.  A body is a list of _queries_.

```eval
cat rules/rule1.rego
```

```rego
:input inputs/resource1.json
:load rules/rule1.rego
account_id  # ?
```

## What is a query?

A query is a pure function that takes the current environment, and produces a
list of new environments:

```rego
numbers = ["zero", "one"]
x = numbers[i]; [i, x]  # ?
```

## What is a query?

A query is a pure function that takes the current environment, and produces a
list of new environments:

```rego
numbers = ["zero", "one"]
x = "one"
x = numbers[i]; [i, x]  # ?
```

## What is a query?

A query is a pure function that takes the current environment, and produces a
list of new environments:

```rego
numbers = ["zero", "one"]
i = 3
x = numbers[i]; [i, x]  # ?
```

## What is a query?

A query is a pure function that takes the current environment, and produces a
list of new environments:

    numbers = ["zero", "one"]
    x = numbers[i]; [i, x]

 -  `{}           ->  [{i = 0, x = "zero"}, {i = 1, x = "one"}]`
 -  `{x = "one"}  ->  [{i = 1, x = "one"}]`
 -  `{i = 3}      ->  []`

## What is inside the Rego tree?

Rules can have _bodies_.  A body is a list of _queries_.

```eval
cat rules/rule1.rego
```

## Kind of rules

There are different kinds of rules:

 -  Complete rule (_single result_)
 -  Set rules (_generate sets_)
 -  Object rules (_generate objects_)

And then there are functions which are slightly different:

 -  Partial rules (_aka functions_)

All of these rules can have a body consisting of queries.

## Kind of rules

### Set rules

```eval
cat rules/rule2.rego
```

```rego
:input inputs/resource1.json
:load rules/rule1.rego
:load rules/rule2.rego
allowed_ports  # ?
```

## Kind of rules

### Object rules

```eval
cat rules/rule3.rego
```

```rego
:input inputs/resource1.json
:load rules/rule1.rego
:load rules/rule3.rego
allowed_ports  # ?
```

## Functions

## Tests

## Unification

```rego
provider = "provider.aws.us-east-1"
region = r {
  [_, _, r] = split(provider, ".")
}

region  # ?
```
